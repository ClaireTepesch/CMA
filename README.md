# CMA Developer Code Test:
Flask framework implementation of art library web application. 
The application displays a different artwork with relevant information each time the webpage is loaded. 

# PART ONE:
 The file DataTransformation.py extracts the data from the art database, creates an array of JSON objects, and then writes the information out to data.txt
 
# PART TWO
Displays a web application through flask framework by parsing through the datafile of art information and displays a randomized selection from the art images with the appropriate information about the displayed artwork. Each time the user loads the page, a different piece will be displayed. 

File organization is as follows: The project is divided into three folders: 
  1. venv
    - app.py
    , data.txt
  2. templates
    - base.html
  3. static
    - Artworks Folder
    , BannerImage.png
    , main.css
  
 # NEXT STEPS
 Include working search bar. Allow users to scroll through images. Improve parsing and display of information of the artworks for better aesthetics and readability.
